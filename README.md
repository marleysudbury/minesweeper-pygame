# Minesweeper in Pygame

Originally written in MonkeyX for my A level project, now recreated in Python with the Pygame library.

## Improvements on the original

* The leaderboard actually works
* You can right click twice to put a question mark
* Cross platform (MonkeyX is supposed to be cross-platform, but it was always glitchy/broken on MacOS)

This version is not yet fully complete (see [issues](https://github.com/marleysudbury/minesweeper-pygame/issues)), but should be soon.
